# Human-Protein-Atlas-Image-Classification
Proposing a neural network architecture capable of classifying protein organelle localization labels, the proposed model was able to reach an accuracy of 95 percent for test data and training data. The proposed model deals with the input of the proposed neural network as three-dimensional (each dimension represents colors (red filter, blue filter, yellow filter, green filter)), and thus the input to the neural network (samples, 2, 90, 90, 3) represents the number 2 In the proposed structure (RGB image, image with yellow filter).
